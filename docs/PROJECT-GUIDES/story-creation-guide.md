# Story Creation Guide: Dependencies & Resources Framework

## Overview
This guide establishes comprehensive standards for creating high-quality user stories with proper dependency tracking and resource documentation. This framework ensures story interconnections are visible, blocking relationships are clear, and output resources are properly catalogued for consumption by other stories.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dependency Transparency
Every story must clearly document what it depends on and what depends on it, creating a visible network of story relationships.

### 2. Resource Accountability  
Every story must explicitly document what resources, artifacts, and interfaces it produces for consumption by other stories or system components.

### 3. Consumer Awareness
Story creators must understand and document how their outputs will be consumed and design interfaces accordingly.

### 4. Integration Readiness
Stories must include specific requirements for integration testing and validation of interfaces with dependent stories.

## Enhanced Story Template

### Standard Story Structure
```markdown
# Story X.Y: [Descriptive Title]

## User Story
**As a** [specific user role/persona]  
**I want** [specific goal/functionality]  
**So that** [clear business value/outcome]

## Story Classification
- **Epic**: [Parent epic name]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- **Type**: [Feature/Enhancement/Bug Fix/Technical Debt]

## Business Value Assessment (MANDATORY) - KISS Edition

### KISS Reality Check (Complete FIRST)
- **Business Need Validation**: Do users actually need this for their daily ERP workflows?
- **Simplest Solution Check**: What's the most straightforward way to solve this problem?
- **YAGNI Validation**: Are we solving real problems or imaginary future requirements?
- **Over-Engineering Warning**: Is this more complex than the business problem requires?

### Actual ERP User Value
- **Daily Workflow Impact**: How does this improve actual user tasks (creating orders, sending invoices, managing inventory)?
- **Time Savings**: How many minutes/hours does this save users per day/week?
- **Error Reduction**: What specific user errors does this prevent?
- **Process Simplification**: How does this make ERP workflows simpler, not more complex?

### Realistic ROI Analysis

#### Development Investment (Be Honest)
- **Implementation Time**: Actual hours needed (avoid padding with "comprehensive" features)
- **Testing Time**: Realistic test coverage, not exhaustive edge case testing
- **Documentation Time**: Basic documentation, not extensive architectural treatises
- **Total Investment**: Honest estimate without feature creep

#### Real Business Benefits (No Fiction)
- **Confirmed User Needs**: Benefits validated with actual user workflows (not theoretical)
- **Concrete Time Savings**: Specific minutes/hours saved with realistic calculations
- **Actual Error Prevention**: Real errors that actually occur and cost time
- **Process Improvements**: Genuine workflow simplifications

#### ROI Calculation - Reality Based
```
Real ROI = (Actual Time Saved + Actual Error Prevention) / Actual Development Time
```

**Warning Signs of Inflated ROI**:
- ❌ ROI > 500% (usually indicates fictional benefits)
- ❌ "International market" benefits without confirmed international business
- ❌ "Scalability" benefits for features that will have <100 users
- ❌ "Technical debt prevention" for problems that don't exist
- ❌ "Regulatory compliance" for regulations that don't apply

### Success Metrics - Keep It Real
- **User Adoption**: Will users actually use this feature?
- **Business Impact**: Measurable improvement in actual business processes
- **Maintenance Burden**: How much ongoing work will this create?
- **Simplicity Maintained**: Does this make the system simpler or more complex?

## Common Story Creation Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Dependency Anti-Patterns

**Vague Dependencies**:
```markdown
❌ "Depends on user management being done"
✅ "Depends on Story 2.3: User Authentication API (requires JWT validation service)"
```

**Missing Consumer Impact**:
```markdown
❌ "Creates user service"
✅ "Creates user service consumed by Stories 3.1, 3.2 for profile management and access control"
```

**Implicit Resource Requirements**:
```markdown
❌ "Needs database setup"
✅ "Consumes: users collection (from Story 1.2), requires indexes on email and role fields"
```

### ❌ Output Documentation Anti-Patterns

**Generic Output Description**:
```markdown
❌ "Creates REST API"
✅ "Creates REST API: GET/POST /api/users with JSON schema v1.2, rate limited to 100 req/min"
```

**Missing Interface Contracts**:
```markdown
❌ "Provides user data access"
✅ "Provides user data access via UserService.getUser() returning UserProfile object with guaranteed fields: id, email, role, lastLogin"
```

**No Consumer Guidance**:
```markdown
❌ "Creates notification system"
✅ "Creates notification system: NotificationService.send(userId, message, type) with async delivery, max 5 min latency, failure retry up to 3 times"
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Sprint Planning Integration
1. **Dependency Review**: Verify all story dependencies are available or planned
2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure stories producing critical resources are prioritized
3. **Integration Planning**: Schedule integration testing for stories with complex dependencies
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify stories with high dependency risk

### Development Process Integration
1. **Story Kickoff**: Review dependencies and consumer requirements with team
2. **Interface Design**: Design APIs and schemas with consumer needs in mind
3. **Implementation**: Build with integration points as primary consideration
4. **Testing**: Validate integration contracts before marking story complete

### Documentation Updates
1. **Resource Catalog**: Update central resource registry with new outputs  
2. **Consumer Notifications**: Alert dependent story owners when interfaces are ready
3. **Integration Guides**: Update documentation for consuming the new resources
4. **Lessons Learned**: Document dependency and integration lessons for future stories

## Resource Tracking System

### Central Resource Registry
Create and maintain a central catalog of all story outputs:

```markdown
# Project Resource Registry

## API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Owner Story | Consumer Stories | Schema Version | Status |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| GET /api/countries | Story 1.2 | Story 2.3, 4.1 | v1.0 | Stable |

## Database Collections  
| Collection | Owner Story | Consumer Stories | Schema Version | Migration Status |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| countries | Story 1.1 | Story 1.2, 2.3 | v1.1 | Complete |

## Services
| Service | Owner Story | Consumer Stories | Interface Version | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| CountryService | Story 1.1 | Story 1.2, 4.1 | v1.0 | Stable |
```

### Dependency Tracking Matrix
Maintain visibility of story interconnections:

```markdown
# Story Dependency Matrix

| Story | Depends On | Blocks | Status | Risk Level |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1.3 | 1.1, 1.2 | 2.1, 4.1 | In Progress | Medium |
| 2.1 | 1.1 | 2.3, 3.1 | Planned | Low |
```
