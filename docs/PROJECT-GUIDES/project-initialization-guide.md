# Project Initialization Guide: Bootstrapping Quality Systems

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for initializing any project with our complete development methodology and quality improvement system. It includes automated scripts, templates, and checklists to rapidly deploy the **Document → Analyze → Refine → Approve** framework.

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Full Automated Setup (Recommended)
Use the initialization script to automatically set up all project guides and templates:
```bash
./scripts/init-project-guides.sh [project-path] [project-name]
```

### Option 2: Manual Selective Setup
Copy specific components based on project needs using the step-by-step checklist below.

### Option 3: Template Repository Clone
Clone the template repository and customize for your specific project requirements.

- [ ] Create `/docs/PROJECT-GUIDES/` directory
- [ ] Create `/docs/standards/` directory  
- [ ] Create `/docs/analysis/` directory
- [ ] Create `/docs/epics/` directory
- [ ] Create `/docs/sprints/` directory
- [ ] Create `/.claude/` directory
```

### Phase 2: Copy Core Methodology Files
```markdown
- [ ] Copy `development-philosophy.md` to PROJECT-GUIDES/
- [ ] Copy `quality-gates-framework.md` to PROJECT-GUIDES/
- [ ] Copy `adr-registry.md` to PROJECT-GUIDES/
- [ ] Copy `adr-process-guide.md` to PROJECT-GUIDES/
- [ ] Copy `story-creation-guide.md` to PROJECT-GUIDES/

## Template Repository Approach

### Creating a Template Repository
```bash
# Create template repository structure
mkdir project-guides-template
cd project-guides-template

# Copy template structure
cp -r /path/to/docs/PROJECT-GUIDES ./docs/
cp -r /path/to/docs/standards ./docs/
mkdir -p docs/{analysis,epics,sprints}
mkdir -p .claude

# Create template files with placeholders
# Use {{PROJECT_NAME}} as placeholder for project name
# Use {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}} as placeholder for description
```

### Using Template Repository
```bash
# Clone template
git clone [template-repo-url] new-project
cd new-project

# Run customization script
./scripts/customize-project.sh "My New Project" "Project Description"

# Initialize git (if needed)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize project with quality methodology"
```
