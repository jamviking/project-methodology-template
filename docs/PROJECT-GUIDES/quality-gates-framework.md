# Quality Gates Framework: Systematic Approval and Quality Assurance

## Overview
This framework defines systematic quality checkpoints and approval processes that implement the **Document → Analyze → Refine → Approve** methodology at every level of the development hierarchy. Each quality gate ensures completeness, accuracy, and stakeholder alignment before proceeding to the next phase.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Quality Assurance
Quality gates are applied consistently across all development levels:
- **Project Level**: Overall objectives and vision approval
- **PRD Level**: Module requirements and architecture approval  
- **Epic Level**: Feature set and story breakdown approval
- **Sprint Level**: Sprint planning and commitment approval
- **Story Level**: Individual story readiness approval

### 2. Systematic Gate Criteria
Each quality gate has:
- **Entry Criteria**: Prerequisites that must be met before gate review
- **Review Process**: Structured evaluation against established criteria
- **Exit Criteria**: Requirements that must be satisfied for approval
- **Escalation Process**: Clear escalation path for disputes or delays

### 3. Stakeholder-Driven Approval
- **Primary Authority**: You retain final approval authority at all levels
- **Collaborative Process**: Joint analysis and refinement before approval
- **Documented Decisions**: All approvals formally recorded with rationale
- **Change Management**: Controlled process for post-approval modifications
