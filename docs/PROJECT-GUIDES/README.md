# Project Guides: Complete Development Methodology

## Overview
This directory contains the complete development methodology for the project, implementing a systematic **Document → Analyze → Refine → Approve** philosophy that ensures quality at every level of development from project conception to story execution.

## Core Philosophy - KISS First with UI-Parallel Development
Our development methodology prioritizes **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** above all other principles. Every level of work—from objectives to stories—must complete a **KISS Reality Check** before any complex analysis begins. This prevents over-engineering and ensures we build only what users actually need.

**UI-Parallel Development Standard**: Following **[ADR-007: UI-Parallel Development Standard](../standards/ADR-007-ui-parallel-development-standard.md)**, all development efforts must include both backend and UI components developed in coordinated parallel streams. This ensures immediate user feedback and catches UX issues during development rather than after backend completion.

**KISS Supersedes Everything**: When guides suggest complex analysis or comprehensive planning, always ask: "What's the simplest solution that solves the real business problem?"
