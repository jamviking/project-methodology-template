# Gap Analysis Template - KISS Edition

## KISS Reality Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
**Purpose**: Prevent over-engineering by focusing on actual business needs

### ‚ùå **Over-Engineering Warning Signs**
- [ ] Solving theoretical future problems (YAGNI violations)
- [ ] Complex abstractions for simple use cases
- [ ] "Elegant" solutions that require extensive documentation
- [ ] Features inspired by other systems rather than user needs
- [ ] International/enterprise features without concrete business plan

### ‚úÖ **KISS Validation Questions**
1. **Business Reality**: What do users actually need day-to-day?
2. **Simplest Solution**: What's the most straightforward way to solve this?
3. **YAGNI Check**: Are we building for imaginary future requirements?
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Can new team members understand and modify this easily?

### üéØ **ERP Context Check**
- [ ] Feature addresses core ERP workflows (orders, invoicing, inventory, customers)
- [ ] Implementation time matches business value (no 26-hour solutions for 30-minute problems)
- [ ] Solution fits actual user skill level and expectations
- [ ] Complexity justified by concrete business requirements (not theoretical scalability)

## Work Item Information
- **Epic**: [Reference to epic]
- **Sprint**: [Reference to sprint] 
- **Story**: [Reference to story]
- **Analysis Date**: [Date]

## Business Need Validation

### ‚úÖ **Essential Business Requirements**
- [ ] Solves actual user pain points
- [ ] Addresses confirmed business workflows
- [ ] Implementation effort matches business value
- [ ] Users will notice if this feature is missing

### ‚ùå **Over-Engineering Detection**
- [ ] **Feature Complexity**: Is this more complex than the problem requires?
- [ ] **Future-Proofing**: Are we solving problems we don't have?
- [ ] **Academic Solutions**: Are we implementing "best practices" without business justification?
- [ ] **Technology Tourism**: Are we using new tech because it's interesting vs. because it's needed?

## Implementation Reality Check

### Simple Solution Assessment
- [ ] **Direct Approach**: Can this be solved with basic, proven patterns?
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Are we introducing unnecessary external complexity?
- [ ] **Clear Code Path**: Can a new developer follow the logic easily?
- [ ] **Maintenance Simplicity**: Is ongoing support straightforward?

### Complexity Justification (Required if solution is complex)
- **Business Justification**: [Concrete business reason requiring complexity]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [Simpler approaches evaluated and why rejected]
- **Maintenance Plan**: [How complexity will be managed long-term]

## Essential Gaps Only

### Critical Missing Items (Fix These)
- [ ] [Only items that block core functionality]

### Nice-to-Have Items (Consider These)
- [ ] [Only items with clear ROI justification]

### Over-Engineering Items (Eliminate These)
- [ ] [Complex features that don't solve real problems]

## Risk Assessment - KISS Focus

### High Risk (Address Immediately)
- [ ] **Over-engineering risk**: Solution complexity exceeds problem complexity
- [ ] **YAGNI violations**: Building for imaginary future requirements
- [ ] **Technical debt**: Complex solutions that will burden future development

### Medium Risk (Monitor)
- [ ] **Maintenance burden**: Solution requires specialized knowledge to maintain
- [ ] **Integration complexity**: Solution makes other components more complex

### Low Risk (Document Only)
- [ ] [Standard development risks]

## Actionable Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **KEEP (Essential)**
- [ ] [Features that solve real business problems simply]

### üîÑ **SIMPLIFY (Over-Engineered)**  
- [ ] [Complex features that can be simplified without losing business value]

### ‚ùå **ELIMINATE (Over-Engineering)**
- [ ] [Complex features with no concrete business justification]

### üéØ **KISS Alternative Approach**
- **Simple Implementation**: [Describe straightforward solution]
- **Time Savings**: [Hours saved vs complex approach]
- **Maintenance Benefits**: [How simple solution reduces ongoing burden]

## Summary Recommendation

### Business Value vs Complexity Assessment
- **Essential Features**: [List must-have items]
- **Simple Implementation**: [Proposed KISS approach]
- **Eliminated Complexity**: [Over-engineering removed]
- **Time Savings**: [Hours saved through KISS approach]

### Final Recommendation
- [ ] **Proceed as planned** (no over-engineering detected)
- [ ] **Simplify first** (reduce complexity before implementation)  
- [ ] **Eliminate over-engineering** (focus on essential features only)
- [ ] **KISS alternative** (completely different simple approach recommended)

**Template Goal**: Create concise gap analyses that eliminate over-engineering and focus on essential business value through KISS principles.
