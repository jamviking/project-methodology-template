# Development Philosophy: Document → Analyze → Refine → Approve

## Core Philosophy Statement
Our development methodology is built on a systematic, hierarchical quality assurance process that ensures every level of {{PROJECT_NAME}}—from high-level objectives to individual stories—follows a rigorous **Document → Analyze → Refine → Approve** cycle before execution begins.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Quality Gates
Every level of development must complete its quality cycle before proceeding:
```
Project Objectives → PRD → Epic → Sprint → Story → Execution
      ↓              ↓      ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓
   Document     Document Document Document Document Execute
   Analyze      Analyze  Analyze  Analyze  Analyze  Test
   Refine       Refine   Refine   Refine   Refine   Validate
   Approve      Approve  Approve  Approve  Approve  Deploy
```

### 2. Collaborative Decision Making with Final Authority
- **Collaborative Process**: We work together to analyze, refine, and reach agreement
- **Final Authority**: You retain final decision-making authority in case of disagreement
- **Approval Required**: Your explicit approval is required at every stage gate
- **Continuous Refinement**: You can request refinement or even rejection at any point

### 3. Living Documentation
- All documents (PRDs, Epics, Sprints, Stories) can be revisited and revised
- Gap analysis can trigger refinement even after development completion
- Documentation evolves based on implementation learnings
- Process improvements feed back into methodology

### 4. Gap-Driven Improvement
- Systematic gap analysis at every level
- Proactive identification of improvement opportunities
- Evidence-based refinement of processes and deliverables
- Continuous evolution of quality standards

## The Four-Phase Cycle

### Phase 1: Document
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive, clear documentation of objectives, approach, and requirements

**Activities**:
- Define clear objectives and success criteria
- Document approach and key decisions
- Specify requirements and acceptance criteria
- Create detailed implementation plans

**Quality Criteria**:
- Objectives are specific, measurable, achievable
- Approach addresses all identified requirements
- Implementation plan is feasible and complete
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive

**Approval Gate**: Documentation must be approved before proceeding to analysis

---

### Phase 2: Analyze
**Purpose**: Systematically identify gaps, risks, and improvement opportunities

**Activities**:
- Conduct structured gap analysis using established templates
- Identify missing requirements or unclear specifications
- Assess technical and process risks
- Evaluate improvement opportunities
- Validate feasibility and resource requirements

**Quality Criteria**:
- All potential gaps systematically identified
- Risks assessed with mitigation strategies
- Improvement opportunities prioritized
- Feasibility confirmed with available resources

**Approval Gate**: Gap analysis and improvement recommendations must be approved

---

### Phase 3: Refine
**Purpose**: Address identified gaps and implement approved improvements

**Activities**:
- Address all identified gaps in documentation
- Implement approved improvement recommendations
- Refine approach based on analysis findings
- Update implementation plans and timelines
- Resolve any ambiguities or missing elements

**Quality Criteria**:
- All identified gaps addressed satisfactorily
- Improvements implemented as approved
- Documentation updated and consistent
- Implementation approach validated

**Approval Gate**: Refined deliverables must meet all quality criteria and receive approval

---

### Phase 4: Approve
**Purpose**: Provide final authorization to proceed to next level or execution

**Activities**:
- Final review of completed documentation
- Verification that all gaps and improvements addressed
- Confirmation of resource allocation and timeline
- Formal approval to proceed

**Quality Criteria**:
- All previous phases completed satisfactorily
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Team alignment on approach and expectations
- Resources and timeline confirmed

**Authorization**: Explicit approval required before proceeding to execution or next hierarchy level

## Application Across Development Hierarchy

### Project Level (Highest)
**Document**: High-level project objectives, vision, scope, and success metrics
**Analyze**: Strategic gaps, resource requirements, feasibility assessment
**Refine**: Scope adjustments, resource planning, timeline optimization
**Approve**: Authorization to proceed with PRD development

### PRD Level  
**Document**: Comprehensive module requirements, architecture, and specifications
**Analyze**: Technical gaps, integration requirements, dependency analysis
**Refine**: Requirement clarifications, architectural decisions, scope adjustments
**Approve**: Authorization to proceed with Epic breakdown

### Epic Level
**Document**: Feature set breakdown, user journeys, acceptance criteria
**Analyze**: Story dependencies, resource allocation, timeline feasibility
**Refine**: Story prioritization, dependency optimization, risk mitigation
**Approve**: Authorization to proceed with Sprint planning

### Sprint Level
**Document**: Sprint objectives, story allocation, team capacity planning
**Analyze**: Capacity vs. commitment gaps, dependency blocking risks
**Refine**: Story adjustments, capacity reallocation, risk mitigation
**Approve**: Authorization to proceed with Story execution

### Story Level
**Document**: User story, dependencies, resources, acceptance criteria
**Analyze**: Implementation gaps, integration requirements, test strategy
**Refine**: Requirements clarification, dependency resolution, approach optimization
**Approve**: Authorization to proceed with development execution
